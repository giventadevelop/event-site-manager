                      The Diocese of Mavelikara came in to existence on 10th August, 2002 with the decision of the holy Episcopal Synod of Malankara Orthodox Church. Late Lamented H.H.BaseliosMarthoma Mathews II Catholicos formally announced the formation of the Mavelikara diocese of the Malankara Orthodox Churchthrough Kalpana no. 134/2002. His Holiness appointed H.G.Paulose Mar Pachomiosmetropolitan as the first diocesean Metropolitan. The craftsmanship and administrative skills of Mar Pachomios Metropolitan helped the diocese to keep its root fixed for its future growth and development. The priest's and laymen's personal attachment to Pachomios Metropolitan was one of the primary reasons that kept the diocese united in its initial days. Forty-oneparishes and twelve chapels of the dioceses of Kollam, Niranam and Chengannoor, were annexed to the newly formed Mavelikara Diocese. Though the diocese is a newly formed one, it has the rich heritage kept by its ancient churches and communities. The spiritual guidance of H.G. Dr.Geevarghese Mar Osthathios, H.G.Mathews Mar Epiphanios and H.G. Thomas Mar Athanasius to the parishes from their respective dioceses was priceless in formulating the spiritual foundation of the diocese.
