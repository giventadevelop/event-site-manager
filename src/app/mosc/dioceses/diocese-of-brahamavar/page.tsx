                      Smallest in size and weakest in financial background, this Diocese is growing and developing by the Grace of God and through the prayers and help of faithful priests and people of all the parishes, especially of St. George Orthodox Cathedral Abu Dhabi, and with the help of many well-wishers and friends. This Diocese is unique in terms of diversities of culture, language and region. It is spread over Cannoor and Kasaragod in Kerala, Dakshina Kannada, Uduppi, Chikmangalore and Coorg in Karnataka, Goa and Abu Dhabi in UAE. Languages used are Malayalam, Konkani, Kannada, Tulu, English and Hindi. Brahmavar Diocese is very unique also because of our Konkani Orthodox Community with our Konkani Priests. Konkani Community is the only non Malayali community in our Church .Konkani Orthodox members are with the Malankara Orthodox Church due to the vision and mission of two saintly and dedicated Roman Catholic priests, 125 years ago, who accepted our Church and faith. They were Revd. Fr. Antonio Franscico Xavier Alvaris who was consecrated later as Metropolitan Alvares Mar Julius I and Revd. Fr. Roque Zephrin Noronah.
