                        He was elected to the Episcopal rank in 1989 and thus became a monk in 1990 and was subsequently ordained in 1991. Soon, he was appointed as the Assistant Metropolitan, Mumbai Dioceses, and worked steadfast with late Dr Philipose Mar Theophilus for the progress of the Mumbai Diocese.

Dn George became a priest in 1975 and served as Vicar, St Gregorios Church, London. He is known for his works among students and thus was serving the MGOCSM as general secretary for almost a decade. This paved way for Fr George to visit many foreign countries.
